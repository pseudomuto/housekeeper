A ClickHouse schema management tool heavily inspired by [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/), built specifically to address the gaps in ClickHouse support that Atlas couldn't fill.

> **NOTE**: This is very much still a WIP and heavily focused on my own needs. I intend to continue development as
available. And of course, PRs are welcome and encouraged.

## Why This Exists

While Atlas is an excellent database schema management tool, its ClickHouse support falls short of what's needed for production ClickHouse deployments. Critical ClickHouse features like `ON CLUSTER` operations, `PARTITION BY` clauses, materialized view management, and dictionary operations either weren't supported or had significant limitations.

Rather than wait for Atlas to catch up with ClickHouse's unique requirements, Housekeeper was created as a purpose-built solution that understands ClickHouse's distributed nature, specialized data types, and advanced features from the ground up.

## Key Features

- **Complete ClickHouse DDL Support** - Full support for databases, tables, dictionaries, views, and materialized views
- **Cluster-Aware Operations** - Native `ON CLUSTER` support for distributed ClickHouse deployments
- **Intelligent Migration Generation** - Smart schema comparison with proper operation ordering
- **Modern Parser Architecture** - Built with participle for robust, maintainable SQL parsing
- **Professional SQL Formatting** - Clean, consistent output optimized for ClickHouse
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Extensive test suite with 100% DDL operation coverage

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/pseudomuto/housekeeper@latest

# Initialize a new project
mkdir my-clickhouse-project && cd my-clickhouse-project
housekeeper init

# Configure database connection (recommended)
export HOUSEKEEPER_DATABASE_URL="localhost:9000"

# Define your schema in db/main.sql, then generate migrations
housekeeper diff

# Apply migrations to your database
housekeeper migrate

# Check migration status
housekeeper status
```

### Connection Configuration

Housekeeper uses a unified connection approach for all database commands:

```bash
# Set once via environment variable (recommended)
export HOUSEKEEPER_DATABASE_URL="localhost:9000"

# Or use --url flag with each command
housekeeper migrate --url localhost:9000
housekeeper status --url localhost:9000
housekeeper schema dump --url localhost:9000
```

Supported connection formats:
- Simple: `localhost:9000`
- Full DSN: `clickhouse://user:password@host:9000/database`
- TCP: `tcp://host:9000?username=user&password=pass`

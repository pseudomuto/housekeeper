A ClickHouse schema management tool heavily inspired by [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/), built specifically to address the gaps in ClickHouse support that Atlas couldn't fill.

## Why This Exists

While Atlas is an excellent database schema management tool, its ClickHouse support falls short of what's needed for production ClickHouse deployments. Critical ClickHouse features like `ON CLUSTER` operations, `PARTITION BY` clauses, materialized view management, and dictionary operations either weren't supported or had significant limitations.

Rather than wait for Atlas to catch up with ClickHouse's unique requirements, Housekeeper was created as a purpose-built solution that understands ClickHouse's distributed nature, specialized data types, and advanced features from the ground up.

## Key Features

- **Complete ClickHouse DDL Support** - Full support for databases, tables, dictionaries, views, and materialized views
- **Cluster-Aware Operations** - Native `ON CLUSTER` support for distributed ClickHouse deployments
- **Intelligent Migration Generation** - Smart schema comparison with proper operation ordering
- **Modern Parser Architecture** - Built with participle for robust, maintainable SQL parsing
- **Professional SQL Formatting** - Clean, consistent output optimized for ClickHouse
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Extensive test suite with 100% DDL operation coverage
